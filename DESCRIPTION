Description: Extending 'surveillance::hhh4()'
    for zero-inflated infectious disease counts as described in
    Lu and Meyer (2023) <doi:10.1002/bimj.202100408>.
    This package is a partial fork of 'surveillance'
    and intended as a proof of concept for this model extension.
    It will be merged with other extensions in the future.
